    ```

5.  **Set Up Environment Variables**
    Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add the following configuration variables. You will need to sign up for the respective services to get the necessary keys.
    ```env
    # /server/.env

    # MongoDB Connection String
    MONGO_URI="[Your_MongoDB_Connection_String]"

    # JWT Secret Key for Authentication
    JWT_SECRET="[Your_Super_Secret_Key]"
